Exercise 7:-
Write an algorithm for accepting the distance and speed values for a particular journey, calculate the time taken for the journey and display the same.

Pseudo Code: 

CalculateTime(DISTANCE, SPEED):
  IF SET != 0 THEN
    SET TIME = DISTANCE / SPEED
    PRINT TIME
  ELSE
    PRINT "Speed cannot be zero"
  ENDIF
END
